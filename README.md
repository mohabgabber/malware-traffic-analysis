# malware-traffic-analysis
I will solve challenges from the [malware-traffic-analysis.net](https://malware-traffic-analysis.net) website in this repo.
The challenges are organized by their date, for example, the challenge [2020-01-30 - TRAFFIC ANALYSIS EXERCISE - SOL-LIGHTNET](https://www.malware-traffic-analysis.net/2020/01/30/index.html) will be placed in a directory named "2020-01-30".
Each directory will have all the files required for you to solve the CTF yourself, and an article in which I'll explain my methodology and thinking process to solve the challenge.

Enjoy!
